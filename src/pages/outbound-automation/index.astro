      "Most outbound fails for one boring reason: the system isn’t designed to run daily without breaking. Tools are fine. The operating model is usually the problem.",

    paragraphs: [
      "Targeting is too broad: people spam titles instead of building a real ICP with exclusions and signals.",
      "Personalization is fake: “Saw you do X” copy that’s obviously templated gets ignored and trains inbox providers against you.",
      "No guardrails: no throttling, no ramping, no monitoring, no QA on lists, and no feedback loop from replies into targeting."

      "We build outbound as an end-to-end system: ICP rules, list sourcing, enrichment, segmentation, sequences, and reply handling.",
      "Automation happens where it’s safe: data, research summaries, prioritization, and routing. Messaging stays sharp, human, and on-brand."

      "A working outbound engine your team can run: documented workflows, templates, QA checks, and a weekly cadence.",
      "If you already have a stack (Apollo, Clay, Instantly, HubSpot, n8n), we plug into it and make it operate like a machine."
