      "Cold email deliverability is your ability to reach the primary inbox consistently. It’s not open rate. It’s not “we warmed the domain for 2 weeks.” It’s whether inbox providers trust your sending identity enough to place your email where humans will see it.",
      "If you’re getting clicks but no bookings, or your results swing week to week, deliverability is usually the hidden bottleneck."

    paragraphs: [
      "Authentication: SPF, DKIM, and DMARC need to be correct. This is the minimum. If it’s wrong, you’re playing outbound on hard mode.",
      "Sending identity: domain age, inbox reputation, and consistent sending patterns matter more than people want to admit.",
      "List quality: bad targeting and dirty lists create bounces, spam complaints, and low engagement, which train providers to distrust you.",
      "Content + links: overly salesy language, aggressive formatting, too many links, and tracking setups can tank placement.",
      "Operational discipline: ramp schedules, segmentation, reply handling, and throttling are what keep you stable once volume increases."
    ]

  {
    h2: "What a sane deliverability system looks like",
    paragraphs: [
      "A real setup is multiple domains, clean authentication, controlled ramping, and clear sending rules by segment. You’re protecting reputation while still getting volume.",
      "You also track what matters: bounce rate, spam placement checks, reply rates by domain, and early warning signals before your pipeline disappears."
    ]

    h2: "How GTM Vector helps",
    paragraphs: [
      "We audit your current setup, fix what’s broken, and implement a repeatable operating model: domains, inboxes, warmup, sending rules, and monitoring.",
      "The outcome is predictable inbox placement, stable reply rates, and inbound meetings that don’t vanish the moment you scale."
